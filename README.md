# Healthcare-Data-Analysis
In this article, I'll share my experience building a comprehensive healthcare data analysis dashboard in just two days, focusing on patient waitlists.

Project Overview :
The dashboard aimed to provide a clear and concise overview of patient waitlists, allowing healthcare providers to:
1) Track the current status of patient waiting lists,
2) Analyze historical trends in inpatient and outpatient waitlists,
3) Conduct detailed specialty-level and age profile analysis

Requirement Gathering:

**Identifying Stakeholders:** Establishing clear communication channels with key stakeholders was crucial for understanding their needs and ensuring the dashboard aligned with organizational objectives.

**Understanding Business Objectives:** Defining specific goals and KPIs helped guide the development process and ensure the dashboard provided actionable insights.

**High-Level Data Study:** Analyzing the data source, structure, and quality was essential for determining the project's feasibility and identifying potential challenges.

**Defining Scope:** Clearly outlining the scope of the dashboard, including key metrics, views, and timelines, helped manage expectations and resources.

**Data Collection:** Accessing the patient waitlist data was the first step in the project. Ensuring data accuracy and completeness was critical for reliable analysis.

**Data Transformation and Modeling:**  

Cleaning and Preparing Data: Removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format was essential for accurate analysis.

Creating Data Models: Developing appropriate data models, such as star or snowflake schemas, helped organize and structure the data for efficient querying and analysis.

**Data Visualization Blueprint:** Choosing the most effective visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, tables) to represent the key metrics and insights was crucial for clarity and understanding.

**Dashboard Layout and Design:**  An intuitive and user-friendly interface was essential for easy navigation and understanding of the dashboard.

**Adding Interactivity and Navigation:**  Incorporating interactive elements allowed users to drill down into specific details and explore different scenarios.
